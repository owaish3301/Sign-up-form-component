## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

Implementation of regex in js and getting accessing values from input fiels.

### Continued development

I would like to make the page more dynamic, so that when the error message is being displayed and user starts to write stuff in the input
box it should remove the error message instantly and if the user backspaced and made the field empty error message should be displayed again
